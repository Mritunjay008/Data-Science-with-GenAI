    "## Code â†’ Program â†’ Process\n",
    "- When we run a program, the computer treats it as a **process**.\n",
    "- A **process** is an instance of a program that executes in a processor.\n",
    "- Execution can be **sequential** or **parallel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of sequential execution\n",
    "test()  # Takes 1 second\n",
    "test()  # Takes another 1 second\n",
    "# Total execution time: 2 seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of parallel execution\n",
    "test()  # Runs in 1 second\n",
    "            > Total execution time: 1 second\n",
    "test()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By running the program on multiple processors, it can execute **in parallel**, leading to better performance.\n",

    "## What is Multithreading?\n",
    "- A **process** can be divided into multiple **threads**.\n",
    "- A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process.\n",
    "- By default, a process runs on a **single thread** â†’ this is called a **single-threaded process**.\n",
    "- Using multiple threads within a process is called **multithreading**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Multithreading Works\n",
    "- **Single Processor â†’ Multiple Threads**\n",
    "- Multithreading allows concurrent execution of threads within a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ **Parallel Execution vs Concurrency**\n",
    "- **Parallel execution**: Two or more processes execute at the same time.\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: Two or more threads execute sequentially but may overlap in execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Concurrency\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test()  # Thread 1 takes 10 sec to execute\n",
    "# At 5th second, Thread 2 starts execution (takes 10 sec)\n",
    "# Thread 1 resumes after Thread 2 completes\n",
    "```\n",
    "At one point, only **one** thread executes on the processor due to Python's **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**.\n",

    "## Multithreading Practical in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Main Thread\n",
    "In Python, the main thread is responsible for executing the program. When we create multiple threads, the main thread starts them and continues executing other tasks unless explicitly controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Thread Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Main thread starts t1 and t2\n",
    "\n",
    "test()  # Thread t1 starts\n",
    "\n",
    "test()  # Thread t2 starts\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the main thread starts **t1** and **t2**, but other processes will continue executing in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Execution Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "t1 ---->                     \\\n",
    "t2 ---->                    --> Before t1 and t2 complete, the main thread executes.\n",
    "print(\"The execution time\")  /\n",
    "```\n",
    "The main thread does not wait for **t1** and **t2** to complete before proceeding, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `join()` to Synchronize Threads\n",
    "To ensure that **t1** and **t2** complete before the main thread executes further operations, we use the `join()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "t1.join()  # Ensures t1 completes before continuing\n",
    "t2.join()  # Ensures t2 completes before continuing\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Effect of `join()`\n",
    "- **First**, t1 executes completely.\n",
    "- **Then**, t2 executes completely.\n",
    "- **Finally**, the main thread continues execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures proper synchronization and prevents race conditions in multithreading programs.\n",
