Currently, pandas.ArrowDtype.type does not correctly handle this new type.\\n\\nThe `ArrowDtype.type` method is crucial for various pandas dtype APIs, including `pd.api.types.pandas_dtype()` and `pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype()`. When used with `pd.ArrowDtype(pa.json_(pa.string()))`, these APIs produce unexpected results.\\n\\nThe issue is that the pandas `ArrowDtype.type` method should return the underlying storage type of the arrow json type.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\n`pa.json_` is a standard Arrow extension type. `ArrowDtype.type` should accurately return its storage type, mirroring the behavior of other Arrow extension types.\\nSpecifically, `pd.ArrowDtype(pa.json_(pa.string())).type` should reflect the storage type, which is `pa.string()` as shown below.\\n\\nCodes to show arrow storage type for `pa.json_`:\\n```python\\n$ import pyarrow as pa\\n$ pa.json_(pa.string()).storage_type\\nDataType(string)\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.12.1\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.10.11-1rodete2-amd64\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.10.11-1rodete2 (2024-10-16)\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : \\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.2\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 23.2.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 8.32.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : 2025.2.0\\njinja2                : None\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.0\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : 0.27.0\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 19.0.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.4\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.15.1\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.38\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

The ensuing segmentation fault is completely random (so very hard to diagnose).\\n\\nHence the expected behaviour is to either block these operations, or alternatively to fully allow those if these are to be permitted.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.11.11\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 4.19.0-27-amd64\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Debian 4.19.316-1 (2024-06-25)\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             :\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.0.2\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 24.0\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 8.18.1\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : None\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : None\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.4\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.13.1\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : 2024.7.0\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n</details>\\n\",\n",

Resampling at `2QS-APR` gives the same results for `s1` and `s2` as those shown above.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI'd expect the index of `s2` to also have timestamps on the first of January and July.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.10.12\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.9.3-76060903-generic\\nVersion               : #202405300957~1738770968~22.04~d5f7c84 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed F\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : C.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2024.2\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 24.3.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : 7.3.7\\nIPython               : 8.29.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.2\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.3\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2024.2\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n</details>\\n\",\n",

This error does not seem to prevent the underlying uniqueness computation from happening. In addition to the submitted reproducible example there is a direct causation here in the `Index` object:\\n\\nIf we call `.drop_duplicates` when the Index contains unhashable types, we observe a `TypeError`.\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\nidx = pd.Index([\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\'], [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']])\\nidx.drop_duplicates() # TypeError: unhashable type: \\'list\\'\\n```\\n\\nBut for some reason if we simply ignore the error the first time and try `.drop_duplicates()` again it works and removes the duplicated entities including the unhashable ones?\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\nidx = pd.Index([\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\'], [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']])\\ntry:\\n    idx.drop_duplicates()    # TypeError: unhashable type: \\'list\\'\\nexcept TypeError:\\n    pass\\nprint(idx.drop_duplicates()) # Index([\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']], dtype=\\'object\\')\\n```\\n\\nWhere we can see that the underlying Index implementation populates its hashtable mapping even though the original call to `drop_duplicates` fails. We know this population is successful because the second attempt at `.drop_duplicates` works.\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\nidx = pd.Index([\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\'], [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']])\\nprint(idx._engine.mapping)   # None\\ntry:\\n    idx.drop_duplicates()    # TypeError: unhashable type: \\'list\\'\\nexcept TypeError:\\n    pass\\nprint(idx._engine.mapping)   # <pandas._libs.hashtable.PyObjectHashTable>\\nprint(idx.drop_duplicates()) # Index([\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']], dtype=\\'object\\')\\n```\\n\\nFinally, it appears that attribute checking on a `pandas.DataFrame` causes the `PyObjectHashTable` to be constructed for the column index. This is likely due to the shared code path between `__getattr__` and `__getitem__`.\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3]], columns=[\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\'], [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']])\\nprint(df.columns._engine.mapping)   # None\\nhasattr(df, \\'hello_world\\')\\nprint(df.columns._engine.mapping)   # <pandas._libs.hashtable.PyObjectHashTable>\\nprint(df.columns.drop_duplicates()) # Index([\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']], dtype=\\'object\\')\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI expect that `Index.drop_duplicates()` should work regardless of whether an attribute has been checked or not. The following two snippets should produce equivalent results (whether that is to raise an error or to produce a result):\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd # 2.2.3\\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3]], columns=[\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\'], [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']])\\n\\nprint(df.columns.drop_duplicates()) # Currently produces → TypeError\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd # 2.2.3\\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3]], columns=[\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\'], [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']])\\n\\nhasattr(df, \\'hello_world\\')\\nprint(df.columns.drop_duplicates()) # Currently produces → Index([\\'a\\', [\\'b\\', \\'c\\']], dtype=\\'object\\')\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.12.7\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.6.52-1-lts\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed, 18 Sep 2024 19:02:04 +0000\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : \\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.2\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.0.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : None\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : 6.125.3\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.5\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : None\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 19.0.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.4\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

       "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n* Create a series with `Index` and a MultiIndex to use for reindexing later\\n```python\\n>>> series = pd.Series(\\n...   [26.7300, 24.2550],\\n...   index=pd.Index([81, 82], name='a')\\n... )\\n>>> series\\na\\n81    26.730\\n82    24.255\\ndtype: float64\\n>>> series.index\\nIndex([81, 82], dtype='int64', name='a')\\n>>> other_index = pd.MultiIndex(\\n...   levels=[\\n...     pd.Index([81, 82], name='a'),\\n...     pd.Index([np.nan], name='b'),\\n...     pd.Index([\\n...       '2018-06-01', '2018-07-01'\\n...     ], name='c')\\n...   ],\\n...   codes=[\\n...     [0, 0, 1, 1],\\n...     [0, 0, 0, 0],\\n...     [0, 1, 0, 1]\\n...   ],\\n...   names=['a', 'b', 'c']\\n... )\\n>>> other_index\\nMultiIndex([(81, nan, '2018-06-01'),\\n            (81, nan, '2018-07-01'),\\n            (82, nan, '2018-06-01'),\\n            (82, nan, '2018-07-01')],\\n           names=['a', 'b', 'c'])\\n```\\n\\n* `reindex` to `MultiIndex` (`other_index`) which expands `series.index` by two more levels.\\n* unfortunately the `reindex` sets all values of the original series to NaN which can be fixed by turning `series.index` into a 1-level `MultiIndex` first\\n\\n```python\\n\\n>>> series.reindex(other_index) # this removes all values of the series\\na   b    c         \\n81  NaN  2018-06-01   NaN\\n         2018-07-01   NaN\\n82  NaN  2018-06-01   NaN\\n         2018-07-01   NaN\\ndtype: float64\\n```\\n\\n* apply `to_mi(...)` to turn the `series.index` into a 1-level `MultiIndex`\\n* rerun `reindex` on the new `series` with `MultiIndex` and the values are maintained/filled as expected\\n\\n```python\\n>>> def to_mi(series):\\n...   if isinstance(series.index, pd.MultiIndex):\\n...     series_mi = series.index\\n...   else:\\n...     level_names = [series.index.name]\\n...     level_values = [series.index]\\n...     series_mi = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(level_values, names=level_names)\\n...   series_with_mi = pd.Series(series.values, index=series_mi, name=series.name)\\n...   return series_with_mi\\n... \\n>>> series_mi = to_mi(series)\\n>>> series_mi\\na \\n81    26.730\\n82    24.255\\ndtype: float64\\n>>> series_mi.index\\nMultiIndex([(81,),\\n            (82,)],\\n           names=['a'])\\n>>> series_mi.reindex(other_index)\\na   b    c         \\n81  NaN  2018-06-01    26.730\\n         2018-07-01    26.730\\n82  NaN  2018-06-01    24.255\\n         2018-07-01    24.255\\ndtype: float64\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nIn the above case, `series.reindex(multi_index)` will turn the series values to NaN when the series has a single `Index`. However when the series index is converted to a 1-level `MultiIndex` prior to the `reindex`, the values are maintained and filled as expected.\\n\\nIn my opinion it shouldn't matter if a 1-level `MultiIndex` or an `Index` is used for a `reindex` - the outcomes should be the same.\\n\\nAs a further discussion point (here or elsewhere), this issue (and others) also begs the question why a distinction between `Index` and `MultiIndex` is necessary (I suspect there are historic reasons). I would imagine that many issues (and code) would go away if `MultiIndex` was used exclusively (even for 1-dimensional indices).\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe missing levels in `series_mi` (compared to `other_index`) are added and the values of the partial index from the original series are used to fill the places of the added indices.\\n\\n```\\n>>> series_mi.reindex(other_index)\\na   b    c         \\n81  NaN  2018-06-01    26.730 # from index <81> of `series` (`series_mi`)\\n         2018-07-01    26.730 # from index <81> of `series` (`series_mi`)\\n82  NaN  2018-06-01    24.255 # from index <82> of `series` (`series_mi`)\\n         2018-07-01    24.255 # from index <82> of `series` (`series_mi`)\\ndtype: float64\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 3979e954a339db9fc5e99b72ccb5ceda081c33e5\\npython                : 3.11.11\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.12.11-200.fc41.x86_64\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jan 24 04:59:58 UTC 2025\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : \\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en_AU.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_AU.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+1909.g3979e954a3.dirty\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 24.2\\nCython                : 3.0.11\\nsphinx                : 8.1.3\\nIPython               : 8.32.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.13.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : 1.4.2\\nfastparquet           : 2024.11.0\\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\nhypothesis            : 6.125.2\\ngcsfs                 : 2025.2.0\\njinja2                : 3.1.5\\nlxml.etree            : 5.3.0\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.0\\nnumba                 : 0.61.0\\nnumexpr               : 2.10.2\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.10\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\npyarrow               : 19.0.0\\npyreadstat            : 1.2.8\\npytest                : 8.3.4\\npython-calamine       : None\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\ns3fs                  : 2025.2.0\\nscipy                 : 1.15.1\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.38\\ntables                : 3.10.2\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : 2024.9.0\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.2\\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n\",\n",

I've been looking at `HDFStore.append()` and have encountered several instances where I am unsure of what the best practice is:\\n\\n- Many parameters are unused or have no effect by nature. Do we keep these and document them with an additional statement that they are unused, or do we remove them/un-document them?\\n- Some parameters do have effects but their variable names are misleading such as `min_itemsize` that defines the max size of string columns and `axes` that change the ax**i**s of appending (though technically correct can be misleading). Do we keep them as is and document them as normal or modify the names throughout?\\n- Some parameters have default values of `None` which are later overwritten by sub-function default values (e.g. `nan_rep` and `chunksize`). Do we back-propagate the default values into all sub-functions such that we can document correct default values?\\n- Is there a point in having an append parameter when there exists both `append()` and `put()` which act as near identical wrappers for the same function `_write_to_group()`?\\n\\nAny opinions or resources regarding this will be helpful.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport datetime as dt\\n\\nprint(pd.__version__)  # 2.2.3\\n\\nleft = pd.DataFrame({\\n    'left_date': pd.date_range(dt.date(2025, 1, 1), dt.date(2025, 1, 5)),\\n})\\n\\nleft = left.drop([0, 1])\\n\\nright = pd.DataFrame({\\n    'right_date': pd.date_range(dt.date(2025, 1, 1), dt.date(2025, 1, 5)),\\n    'value': range(5)\\n})\\n\\nmerged = pd.merge_asof(left, right, left_on='left_date', right_on='right_date')\\n\\nindex_before = left.index.tolist()\\nindex_after = merged.index.tolist()\\nprint(index_before)  # [2, 3, 4] since first two dropped\\nprint(index_after)  # should be [2, 3, 4] but is [0, 1, 2]\\n```\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nmerge_asof is has the unexpected side effect of resetting a RangeIndex. If there are gaps in the RangeIndex in the left dataframe ahead of the call, there will be no gaps in the dataframe resulting from the call. \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nBy default, I would expect the index to be untouched, or at least expect an ignore_index keyword argument to be able to control this behavior. \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.11.9\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 10\\nVersion               : 10.0.19045\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : AMD64 Family 25 Model 97 Stepping 2, AuthenticAMD\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : None\\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.2\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.0.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : None\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : None\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : None\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n\",\n",

However, in my case `s1 - s2`, `s1` contains an all `nan` index row which raises a `ValueError: Length of values (5) does not match length of index (4)`.\\n\\nI found that this could be an error in how the two series are aligned.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Series(...):\\n    ...\\n    def _align_series(...):\\n        ...\\n        if not axis:\\n            # equal\\n            if self.index.equals(other.index):\\n                join_index, lidx, ridx = None, None, None\\n            else:\\n                join_index, lidx, ridx = self.index.join(\\n                    other.index, how=join, level=level, return_indexers=True\\n                )\\n\\n                ## At this point, `join_index` is invalid as it contains different length codes:\\n                ## join_index.code ==  FrozenList([[0, 0, 1, 1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2]])\\n                ## which returns (4 items in level index 0)\\n                ##   join_index.get_level_values(0) ==           Index([81.0, 81.0, 82.0, 82.0], dtype=\\'float64\\', name=\\'foo\\')\\n                ## while (5 items in level index 1 and 2)\\n                ##   join_index.get_level_values(1) ==           Index([nan,   nan,  nan,  nan, nan], dtype=\\'float64\\', name=\\'demand_index\\')\\n                ##   join_index.get_level_values(2) == DatetimeIndex([\\'NaT\\', \\'2018-06-01\\', \\'2018-07-01\\', \\'2018-07-01\\', \\'2018-08-01\\'], dtype=\\'datetime64[ns]\\', name=\\'blend_date\\', freq=None)\\n                ##\\n\\n            if is_series:\\n                ## The invalid `join_index` is picked up by `._reindex_indexer(...)` as `len(join_index)` == 4 and `len(new_values) == 5` which causes the `ValueError`\\n                left = self._reindex_indexer(join_index, lidx, copy)\\n        ...\\n\\n\\n\\n    def _reindex_indexer(...):\\n        ...\\n        new_values = algorithms.take_nd(\\n            self._values, indexer, allow_fill=True, fill_value=None\\n        )\\n        return self._constructor(new_values, index=new_index, copy=False)  ## <- raises the ValueError\\n```\\n\\nI traced the origin of the mismatching codes to `pandas.core.indexes.base.py:Index._join_level` which blatantly ignores missing values to construct a new index.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Index(...):\\n     def _join_level(...):\\n        ...\\n        else:\\n            left_lev_indexer = ensure_platform_int(left_lev_indexer)\\n            rev_indexer = lib.get_reverse_indexer(left_lev_indexer, len(old_level))\\n            old_codes = left.codes[level]\\n\\n            ## This will ignore missing values (nan) without ever inserting\\n            ## those values back into the index, ultimately leading to\\n            ## different length codes\\n            taker = old_codes[old_codes != -1]\\n            new_lev_codes = rev_indexer.take(taker)\\n\\n            new_codes = list(left.codes)\\n            new_codes[level] = new_lev_codes\\n\\n            new_levels = list(left.levels)\\n            new_levels[level] = new_level\\n\\n            if keep_order:  # just drop missing values. o.w. keep order\\n                left_indexer = np.arange(len(left), dtype=np.intp)\\n                left_indexer = cast(np.ndarray, left_indexer)\\n                mask = new_lev_codes != -1\\n                if not mask.all():\\n                    new_codes = [lab[mask] for lab in new_codes]\\n                    left_indexer = left_indexer[mask]\\n            ...\\n            join_index = MultiIndex(\\n                levels=new_levels,\\n                codes=new_codes,\\n                names=left.names,\\n                verify_integrity=False,\\n            )\\n```\\n\\n\\nThis is all possible because `verify_integrity` is set to False (and not passed down). If I set `verify_integrity=True` the `join_index = MultiIndex(...)` fails much earlier with `ValueError: Length of levels and codes must match.

Performing the `namedtuple`-to-`dict` conversion process isn\\'t difficult normally, but in some situation (e.g. doing so in a list/set/dict comprehension), it\\'s more convenient to have a generator that does the process automatically for you.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nAdd a new function to DataFrames, `iterdicts`, that takes an `index` argument (equivalent to the same argument in `itertuples`) and returns each row as a dictionary the same way itertuples does so as a namedtuple. (No need to take a \"name\" argument, since that\\'s irrelevant for dictionaries.)\\n```python\\ndef iterdicts(self, index=True):\\n    for x in self.itertuples(index):\\n        yield x._asdict()\\n```\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nWrite a custom function that does the same thing externally.\\n```python\\ndef iterdicts(df, index=True):\\n    for x in df.itertuples(index):\\n        yield x._asdict()\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_',\n",

This results in a loss of structure and requires additional parsing during data retrieval.\\n\\nMany machine learning practitioners store intermediate results, including embeddings and model-generated representations, in Pandas DataFrames. However, when saving such data using CSV, the complex data types are converted to string format, making them difficult to work with when reloading the DataFrame.\\n\\nCurrent Workarounds:\\n\\nPickle: While Pickle retains structure, it is not cross-platform friendly and has security concerns when loading untrusted files.\\nParquet: Parquet supports complex structures better but may not be the default choice for many users who rely on CSV.\\nManual Parsing: Users often need to reprocess stringified NumPy arrays back into their original format, which is inefficient and error-prone.\\nFeature Request:\\nIntroduce an option in Pandas to serialize and deserialize complex data types when saving to and loading from CSV, possibly by:\\n\\nAllowing automatic conversion of NumPy arrays to lists during CSV storage.\\nProviding a built-in method for reconstructing complex data types when reading CSV files.\\nSupporting a more intuitive way to store and load multi-dimensional data efficiently without requiring workarounds.\\n\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\n1. Modify to_csv() to Handle Complex Data Types\\nIntroduce a new parameter (e.g., preserve_complex=True) in to_csv() that automatically converts NumPy arrays to lists before saving.\\n\\nPseudocode:\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nclass EnhancedDataFrame(pd.DataFrame):\\n    def to_csv(self, filename, preserve_complex=False, **kwargs):\\n        if preserve_complex:\\n            df_copy = self.copy()\\n            for col in df_copy.columns:\\n                if isinstance(df_copy[col].iloc[0], (np.ndarray, list)):  # Check for complex types\\n                    df_copy[col] = df_copy[col].apply(lambda x: json.dumps(x.tolist()))  # Convert arrays to JSON\\n        super().to_csv(filename, **kwargs)\\nIf preserve_complex=True, NumPy arrays and lists are serialized into JSON format before saving.\\nThe standard to_csv() functionality remains unchanged for other users.\\n\\n2. Modify read_csv() to Restore Complex Data Types\\nIntroduce a restore_complex=True parameter in read_csv() that automatically detects JSON-encoded lists and converts them back to NumPy arrays.\\n\\nPseudocode:\\nclass EnhancedDataFrame(pd.DataFrame):\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def from_csv(filename, restore_complex=False, **kwargs):\\n        df = pd.read_csv(filename, **kwargs)\\n        if restore_complex:\\n            for col in df.columns:\\n                if df[col].apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, str) and x.startswith(\"[\")).all():  # Check for JSON format\\n                    df[col] = df[col].apply(lambda x: np.array(json.loads(x)))  # Convert back to NumPy array\\n        return df\\nIf restore_complex=True, JSON-encoded lists are automatically converted back to NumPy arrays when reading a CSV file.\\nExample Usage\\npython\\nCopy\\nEdit\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\'id\\': [1, 2], \\'embedding\\': [np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]), np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])]})\\n\\n# Save with complex type handling\\ndf.to_csv(\"data.csv\", preserve_complex=True)\\n\\n# Load and restore complex types\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\", restore_complex=True)\\nprint(df_loaded[\"embedding\"][0])  # Output: array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])\\n\\nExpected Benefits\\n✅ Users will be able to save and retrieve NumPy arrays, embeddings, or complex objects easily using CSV.\\n✅ Reduces the need for workarounds like Pickle or manual parsing.\\n✅ Keeps Pandas CSV handling more intuitive for machine learning workflows.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nEnhance documentation to recommend best practices for handling complex data types with Pandas and suggest an official approach for this use case.\\n\\nAdditional Context:\\n\\nA common issue in ML workflows that involve embeddings, image vectors, and multi-dimensional numerical data.\\nOther libraries like PyArrow and Dask handle complex data better, but many users prefer Pandas for ease of use.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n1. Using JSON Format Instead of CSV\\nInstead of saving complex data to a CSV file, users can save the DataFrame as a JSON file, which supports nested data structures.\\n\\nExample\\ndf.to_json(\"data.json\", orient=\"records\")\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_json(\"data.json\")\\n✅ Pros:\\nNatively supports lists and dictionaries without conversion.\\nReadable and widely supported format.\\n❌ Cons:\\n\\nJSON files are not as efficient as CSV for large datasets.\\nJSON format is not always easy to work with in spreadsheet software.\\n2. Using Pickle for Serialization\\nPandas provides built-in support for Pickle, which can store and retrieve complex objects.\\n\\nExample\\ndf.to_pickle(\"data.pkl\")\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_pickle(\"data.pkl\")\\n✅ Pros:\\n\\nPreserves complex data types natively.\\nFast read/write operations.\\n❌ Cons:\\nPickle files are not human-readable.\\nThey are Python-specific, making them less portable for cross-platform use.\\n3. Using Parquet for Efficient Storage\\nParquet is a columnar storage format optimized for performance and supports complex data types.\\n\\nExample\\n\\ndf.to_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\\n✅ Pros:\\nEfficient storage with better compression.\\nSupports multi-dimensional data and preserves data types.\\n❌ Cons:\\nRequires pyarrow or fastparquet dependencies.\\nNot as universally used as CSV.\\n4. Manual Preprocessing for CSV Storage\\nUsers often manually convert complex data to JSON strings before saving them to CSV.\\n\\nExample\\nimport json\\ndf[\"embedding\"] = df[\"embedding\"].apply(lambda x: json.dumps(x.tolist()))\\ndf.to_csv(\"data.csv\", index=False)\\n\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\\ndf_loaded[\"embedding\"] = df_loaded[\"embedding\"].apply(lambda x: np.array(json.loads(x)))\\n✅ Pros:\\nWorks with existing Pandas functionality.\\nCSV remains human-readable.\\n❌ Cons:\\nRequires manual preprocessing each time.\\nError-prone and inefficient for large datasets.\\n\\nWhy the Proposed Feature is Needed\\nWhile these alternatives exist, they require either additional dependencies, manual preprocessing, or compromise on format usability. Adding native support for preserving and restoring complex data types in Pandas CSV operations would:\\n\\nEliminate the need for external libraries like JSON, Pickle, or Parquet.\\nImprove usability for machine learning and data science workflows.\\nKeep CSV files human-readable while ensuring data integrity.',\n",
